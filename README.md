# distributions
implementing several probability density functions for different distributions ( gaussian, uniform, Erlang, etc...).
---

### Work in progress

* I want to implement a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). I'm currently using the standard srand for seeding and rand() to generate random samples. 

* Calculating mean and variance hasn't been implemented yet. I'll do that when I have time. For now, the values are fixed (zero mean, variance = 1).

* will also write output to a file. This is important, otherwise, what's the point of having this program?
